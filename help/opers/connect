/CONNECT <server_A> [port] [server_B]

When [server_B] is used, CONNECT asks [server_B] to
connect to <server_A>. The [port] must be specified 
with [server_B], this is usually 4400.

When [server_B] is not used, CONNECT tries to connect
your server to <server_A>.

When [port] is used, the connection will be attempted
to [port]. When [port] is not used, 4400 is used as a
default, unless the port is specified in the conf file.
