If you are removing a spamfilter then:
/REMOVE [spamfilter] [reason] :[mask]
Otherwise:
/REMOVE [gline|zline|shun] [mask] :[reason]

Removes the given gline, shun or shun from the network weather
its deactivated or activated. This command should be used VERY
carefully. If a gline, shun, spamfilter or zline is removed while
a server is split then it will be reinstated when the split server
rejoins the network.

If you are removing a spamfilter then use _'s instead of spaces
in the reason. These will be decoded when the reason is displayed.

You need to have the REMOVE priv to use this command.
