    matched a filter line and the message has been denied.
m - Mark, will mark the client as being a spam source.
K - Kick, will kick the user triggering the Spam Filter. The kick reason given
    will be the reason set in the Spam Filter. This Flag will only work with the
    N and C watch flags.
o - Ops/Halfops, if added it will exempt halfops and ops from being any checks
    which have a channel target. They of course need to be an op or halfop to be
    exempt from the check. Be careful with this flag.
v - Voice, if added it will exempt voiced users from any checks which have a
    channel target. If channels have auto voice enabled then this will mean
    spammers can still spam the channel.

This command requires the SPAMFILTER priv.
