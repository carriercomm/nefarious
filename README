We apologize if we have missed an IRCd or tool in the list.
If you see parts of your code being used in Nefarious and do not see 
your IRCd/tool above, please contact one of the developers of Nefarious.

If you are running the development version of Nefarious IRCu on a 
production network, you are doing so at your own peril. We take NO 
RESPONSIBILITY for ANYTHING it might do on your network. We strongly 
recommend that you do NOT run the development version on a production 
network! You have been warned.

- *IMPORTANT NOTICE* --------------------------------------------------

Do NOT ask for support for Nefarious IRCu in #coder-com on Undernet.
The official support channel for Nefarious IRCu is on the AfterNET IRC
Network (irc.afternet.org) in #evilnet. #coder-com on Undernet is ONLY
for normal IRCu and GNUWorld. If you have found bugs in Nefarious IRCu,
do NOT submit them to coder-com@undernet.org or to the undernet-ircu
SourceForge site. Send them to any of the Nefarious IRCu mailing lists
or the Nefarious IRCu SourceForge project site. If you submit a bug
and we find out it's a bug which affects undernet-ircu, then we will
forward the report on.

- ssl notes -----------------------------------------------------------

If you have enabled SSL (--enable-ssl) then no doubt you will want to
use port 994 for your SSL port, as it is standard. You should know that
non-root users can't use ports under 1024 and the ircd wont run as root,
so this becomes an issue. This can be fixed with the Bounce tool
(tools/Bounce). You will need to have root access for this to work.

cd tools/Bounce
./build
edit bounce.conf (you will see a ssl example at the bottom)

P:192.168.10.5:994:192.168.10.1:8000

What this line will do is, bind port 994 to 192.168.10.5 and any
connections received on it will be fowarded to 192.168.10.1 port 8000, 
port 8000 being a ssl configured port on the ircd (E).

More Examples

P:210.55.131.133:994:210.55.131.133:7000
P:123.123.123.123:994:203.86.91.12:6665

after the bounce.conf is done run
./bounce &

If you wish to run bounce in another dir then either copy the Bounce 
dir out or copy the bounce binary and bounce.conf to another directory 
and run.

- added ircd.conf lines -----------------------------------------------

[R:lines]

These are redirection lines, when a client connects and his/her host
matches a R:line then a 010 reply is sent with the redir server and
port. Currently only epic supports a autoredirection when it gets a
010 reply (ie it will automatically connect to the server said in the
010 reply. Other clients will get a nessage saying what server and
port to connect to. Aswell as a unauthorised connection quit.

Syntax:
 R:<mask>:<redirection server>:<redirection port>

Examples:
 R:*.aol.com:irc.aol.com:6667
 R:*.us:us.nefarious.irc:6667
 R:*.nz:nz.nefarious.irc:6667


[S:lines]

Syntax:
 S:<spoof host>:<password>:<*.host.cc|a.b.c.*|CIDR>:<ident>
<spoof host>  A hostname to be spoofed
<password>    A password for this spoof host. Used if SETHOST_USER is enabled.
<hostmask>    A hostmask for matching against users that are to be auto
              spoofed. Used if SETHOST_AUTO is enabled. Can be of form:
              host.domain.cc, 127.0.0.1 or 127.0.0.0/24, supports wildcards
              for non-CIDR.
<ident>       A mask for matching against the user's ident reply.

Examples:
Oper sethost for 'moo.fish.moo'
 S:moo.fish.moo:::
User & Oper sethost for 'moo.fish.moo'
 S:moo.fish.moo:elitepassword::
Oper sethost for 'moo.fish.moo' with auto on 'ident@*.example.com"
 S:moo.fish.moo::*.example.com:ident
Oper sethost for 'moo.fish.moo' with auto on 'user*@*.example.com"
 S:moo.fish.moo::*.example.com:user*


[B:lines]
These are lines intended to improve the generic irc users ability to
use network services. Each line sets up a /<service> alias so that
users may type that instead of a full /msg command.

for example.. adding:
 B:X:cservice@nefarious.irc:*
would result in commands like this being possible
 /X HELP

Syntax:
 B:<name of command/service>:<target>:<anything to prepend to message>

Examples:
 B:X:cservice@nefarious.irc:*
 B:AUTH:AuthServ@nefarious.irc:"AUTH"


[P:Lines]
(Refer to example.conf or ircd.conf for full information on P:Lines)

P:<hostmask>:<interface>:<[CS][E][H]>:<port number>
C- Client
S- Service
E- SSL Port
H- Hidden Port
 
This is a Encrypted SSL Port
P:::E:7000


[F:Lines]
(Refer to readme.features for more information and their default values)


- installation ---------------------------------------------------------

(see ./configure --help for a range of compile time options)
./configure
make
make install
(ircd.pem generation will be prompted if ircd.pem doesnt exist)

Key Notes:
- If you run a network of more than one client server and host hiding 
  style 2, then your 3 cloak keys need to be the same on each server.
  You can specify each key with configure
  (--with-cloakone=num --with-cloaktwo=num --with-cloakthree=num).

- cygwin installation --------------------------------------------------

see README.cygwin

- configuration --------------------------------------------------------

cd /home/ircduser/lib
pico example.conf (or vi, nano, etc. :)
mv example.conf ircd.conf

Note: to compile mkpasswd do this:
cd tools
make -f Makefile.crypt

- running --------------------------------------------------------------

cd /home/ircduser/bin
./ircd

If all goes well the ircd should run. If not, check your ircd.conf
CAREFULLY for errors.
