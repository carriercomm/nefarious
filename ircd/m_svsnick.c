/*
 * m_functions execute protocol messages on this server:
 *
 *    cptr    is always NON-NULL, pointing to a *LOCAL* client
 *            structure (with an open socket connected!). This
 *            identifies the physical socket where the message
 *            originated (or which caused the m_function to be
 *            executed--some m_functions may call others...).
 *            originated (or which caused the m_function to be
 *            executed--some m_functions may call others...).
 *
 *    sptr    is the source of the message, defined by the
 *            prefix part of the message if present. If not
 *            or prefix not found, then sptr==cptr.
 *
 *            (!IsServer(cptr)) => (cptr == sptr), because
 *            prefixes are taken *only* from servers...
 *
 *            (IsServer(cptr))
 *                    (sptr == cptr) => the message didn't
 *                    have the prefix.
 *
 *                    (sptr != cptr && IsServer(sptr) means
 *                    the prefix specified servername. (?)
 *
 *                    (sptr != cptr && !IsServer(sptr) means
 *                    that message originated from a remote
 *                    user (not local).
 *
 *            combining
 *
 *            (!IsServer(sptr)) means that, sptr can safely
 *            taken as defining the target structure of the
 *            message in this server.
 *
 *    *Always* true (if 'parse' and others are working correct):
 *
 *    1)      sptr->from == cptr  (note: cptr->from == cptr)
 *
 *    2)      MyConnect(sptr) <=> sptr == cptr (e.g. sptr
 *            *cannot* be a local connection, unless it's
 *            actually cptr!). [MyConnect(x) should probably
 *            be defined as (x == x->from) --msa ]
 *
 *    parc    number of variable parameter strings (if zero,
 *            parv is allowed to be NULL)
 *
 *    parv    a NULL terminated list of parameter pointers,
 *
 *                    parv[0], sender (prefix string), if not present
 *                            this points to an empty string.
 *                    parv[1]...parv[parc-1]
 *                            pointers to additional parameters
 *                    parv[parc] == NULL, *always*
 *
 *            note:   it is guaranteed that parv[0]..parv[parc-1] are all
 *                    non-NULL pointers.
