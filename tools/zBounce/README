Bounce - Basic configuration.
-----------------------------

Example 1: Compressing the S<>S data between a hub and a leaf.

* Hub : hubserver.undernet.org (192.168.1.1)
* Leaf: leafy.undernet.org (10.1.1.1)

Install bounce on both irc machines and set the configs as below.
This configuration allows for the initialisation of a compressed connection
from both sides.

For further examples see: docs/zbounce_ircd.example
 
Hub Bounce Config
-----------------

P:192.168.1.1:8400:10.1.1.1:8500
 
* This sets bounce to listen on the local interface 192.168.1.1 on port 8400 for 
* uncompressed input (from ircu) and to forward any connections recieved on this
* to 10.1.1.1 on port 8500 in a compressed form.

p:192.168.1.1:8500:192.168.1.1:4400
 
* This sets bounce to listen on the local interface 192.168.1.1 on port 8500 for 
* compressed input and to forward any connections recieved on this to 192.168.1.1
* on port 4400 (to ircu) in a uncompressed form.

Hub ircu:

Add/Change a C: line for leafserver.undernet.org with IP 192.168.1.1. Make this is
the last C line in the config for the leaf, so that this IP will be used to connect to
the bounce.

Then to initiate a compressed connection, /connect leafser* 8400.

---END OF HUB CONFIG---

 
Leaf Bounce Config
------------------

P:10.1.1.1:8400:192.168.1.1:8500
 
* This sets bounce to listen on the local interface 10.1.1.1 on port 8400 for
* uncompressed input (from ircu) and to forward any connections recieved on this
* to 192.168.1.1 on port 8500 in a compressed form.

p:10.1.1.1:8500:10.1.1.1:4400

* This sets bounce to listen on the local interface 10.1.1.1 on port 8500 for
* compressed input and to forward any connections recieved on this to 10.1.1.1
* on port 8400 (to ircu) in a uncompressed form.
 
Leaf ircu:

Add/Change a C: line for hubserver.undernet.org with IP 10.1.1.1. Make this is the
last C line in the config for the hub, so that this IP will be used to connect to
the bounce.

Then to initiate a compressed connection, /connect hubser* 8400.

---END OF LEAF CONFIG---

Once a connection is established from either end, the flow of data goes compressed
in both directions (hub->leaf, leaf->hub).
